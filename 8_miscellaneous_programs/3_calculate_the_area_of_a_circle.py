"""
Description:

- Write a Python program that finds the area of a circle from the value of the diameter d.

- The value of d should be provided by the user.

- The area of a circle is equal to pi*(radius)^2. The radius is the value of the diameter divided by 2.

- Round the value of the area to two decimal places.

- You may assume that the value of the diameter will be non-negative integer.
